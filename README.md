CSU-Train-Project
=================

This was the senior software engineering train controller project. This project involved a group of students writing code to control a model train around a track. The system used networking to talk to the train. This is thge whole project as it was completed, except for the embedded code I wrote for the hand controller. 

This is the solution to the train project problem in Software Engineering. Our team had to write software that would control model trains, first via a hand controller, then automatically. The trains are attached via network, so the 
I am submitting this project since it was one of the largest projects I have worked on in Java. I worked with the team to create the class layout, and we decided to use interfaces to help us work independently on different sections of Java code. I wrote the code that interfaced with the network, implementing a separate thread that actually communicated with the train. I also wrote the command objects. For this project, I also wrote some code for an Arduino hand controller that I built, making it much easier to control the train.

This project sparked another project I worked on, where I replaced the microcontroller the train used to connect to the network with an Arduino & Netduino based system.
